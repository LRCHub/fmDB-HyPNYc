People are looking but they don't know what to do
It's the time of the reason for the people like you
Come back tomorrow, show the scars on your face
It's a clue to the answer we all chase

Three, five and seven lift the heaviest load
Reach the top of the heaven that's fallen below
Devil may care but you wish for the best
Can't you see there's an answer that lies there

Say
Say
Come all you sinners and keep with the time
Can we see all the faces that have fallen behind
Don't make the reason it's a secret for you
There's a clue to the answer we all know, say
There's no clue to the answer we all know, say

People are looking but they don't know what to do
It's the time of the reason for the people like you
Come back tomorrow, show the scars on your face
It's a clue to the answer we all chase, say
It's a clue to the answer we all chase, say
