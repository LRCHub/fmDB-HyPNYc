Woman, I don't wanna a soul
Hangin' around my house when I'm not home
Oh, I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

I don't want you to answer the door for nobody, baby
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone

I don't want your sister coming by
Because the little girl she talk too much
If she just come by to visit us
Tell her to meet her sunday, down at the church
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

Yes, I don't want you to answer the door for nobody, baby
Oeh, when you're home and you know you're all alone

If your mother wanna visit us
Tell her I get home 'bout the break a day
And that's too late to visit anybody, baby
So, tell you them to please stay away

'Cause I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for anybody, baby
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone

Now you feel a little sick, baby
And you know you're home all alone
I don't want the doctor at my house, baby
You just suffer 'till I get home
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, baby
Yeah, when you're home and all alone
