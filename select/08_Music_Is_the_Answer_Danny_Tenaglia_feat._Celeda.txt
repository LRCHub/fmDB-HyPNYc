When your lost and alone
So far away from your Home
Love is guide the Way
In a pure uncut from
Love feels right keeps you warm
It's helping you everyday
What saves us saves us from fallin'
What saves us saves us from fallin'
Chorus:
Hey Boys and Girls
Like you and me
Our Love is the Answer
This is our Life and we are free
Cause Love is the Answer
Oh Oh Oh
Cause Love is the Answer
Oh Oh Oh
Love is the Answer
I don't think about fear
Is it fake or is it real
I don't believe what I hear
What do we want to hear first
The bad News or the Worst
On Radio or on TV
What saves us saves us from fallin'
What saves us saves us from fallin'
Chorus:
Hey Boys and Girls
Like you and me
Our Love is the Answer
This is our Life and we are free
Cause Love is the Answer
Oh Oh Oh
Cause Love is the Answer
Oh Oh Oh
Love is the Answer
We all need more Desire
Our Love burns like a Fire
Cause Love is the Answer
So let Love be the Answer
Chorus:
Hey Boys and Girls
Like you and me
Our Love is the Answer
This is our Life and we are free
Cause Love is the Answer
Oh Oh Oh
Cause Love is the Answer
Oh Oh Oh
Love is the Answer
