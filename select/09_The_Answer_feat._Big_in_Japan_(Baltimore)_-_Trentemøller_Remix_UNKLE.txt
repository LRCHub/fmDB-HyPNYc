Here we are
Burning up in our cars
And in our hearts
Better days
Sleeping late with a headache
Perfect weather
Congregate
Lay in wait for an answer
They're still waiting
With your tea
Lucky tips as the day breaks
The blind are leading the blind

Better
Better days with a headache
Perfect weather

Xenon lights
Dots go dashing the highways
Nothing's moving
Radiates
Everything lasting for seconds
Evaporated
Lovers' lips
Drinking late at the station
Smiling faces
Comic weep
Wiping your face in whatever
There's an answer

Better
Better days with a headache
Perfect weather
