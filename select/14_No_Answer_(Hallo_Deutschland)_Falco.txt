I got up this morning felt so bad
It's weird, really feel out of whack
I got the urge to call home and I
Go to the and pick up the phone, sayin' -
Just wanted to say to all my friends
"Calling West-Berlin,
Where all those roads lead to an end
Germany am I getting through?
Something's up I need to talk to you.

Hallo Deutschland hört ihr mich?
Via Satelliten hört ihr mich?
Hallo, hallo Deutschland hört ihr mich?
Ist da jemand oder täusch' ich mich?"

A cup of coffee, cigarette baiting time
And I'm still hanging on that line
Ringing up that girl can't be too soon
Saying hey, hey wakeup darling it's afternoon
Got still no answer no reply
Gotta give it one last try
Operator I count on you
(Overseas operator, may I help you?)
You're the one to put me through

Hallo Deutschland ...

Let me know
Let me know

Hallo Deutschland hört ihr mich
(Repeat til fade)
